Mother Earth	Jan 1986	The ancient earth-spirit Akash'Bhuta has bested her continual foe. With this latest Virtuoso of the Void defeated, nothing can possibly stand in her way -- humanity shall finally be laid low! The Argent Adept is rescued by Fanatic, and they are joined by Captain Cosmic and Tempest. They travel to the time-lost island of Insula Primalis, where they find Haka already locked in combat with Void-altered dinosaurs. And with that, the new team known as the Prime Wardens is complete. The heroes descend into the heart of the island to face the spirit of the earth itself...	1	Akash'Bhuta	Heart of the Island	After an Environment card is destroyed, Akash'Bhuta deals each target 2 fire damage.	The Prime Wardens fought their way through the heart of Insula Primalis to separate Akash'Bhuta from that ancient island's power. The Argent Adept had to enter the Void and face her essence alone. He was barely able to survive and sever Akash'Bhuta's connection, but succeed he did. And just in time! The Freedom Five arrived to join forces against the formidable earth spirit. Even still, all would have been lost if not for the timely intervention of a shadowy gunman who seemed to appear from nowhere, take the precisely necessary shot, and disappear without a word. With his aid, the heroes were able to defeat Akash'Bhuta and save the day!	Virtuoso of the Void Vol. 1 #152 Absolution #68 Cosmic Tales Vol. 2 #190 Prime Wardens Vol. 1 #1-#6 Mother Earth One-Shot Freedom Five Annual #10	Bloviating Academic	Soothsayer Carmichael is annoyed by the way you do things. "If you would spend even a moment considering the ramifications of your actions!" he rages, pacing this way and that. He has some good points, but he really needs to get over himself.	Reveal the top 3 cards of 1 deck. Replace them in any order.	Primordial Power	Over millennia, Akash'Bhuta has become a part of this world in a way that cannot be easily undone. In fighting her, you fight the planet itself. Similarly, in defeating her, you gain some dominion over this world.	Destroy and/or bury up to 3 Environment cards.	Core Game	
Moonfall	Apr 1968	The dastardly Baron Blade has a world-ending plan to destroy his nemesis Legacy once and for all! If the Freedom Five don't stop him in time, his terrible plot will spell doom for humanity. The revenge-fueled Baron set up his TerraLunar Impulsion Beam in the long abandoned ruins of Atlantis, hoping that after the pyrrhic victory of pulling the moon into the earth, he and his forces will emerge to rule what's left. The heroes must find their way through the twisting ruins to destroy the mad baron's doomsday device before it's too late!	0	Baron Blade	My Life for Mordengrad!	Whenever Baron Blade would be dealt damage, reveal the top card of the Villain deck. If it is a Minion card, play it and redirect the damage to that Minion card. Otherwise, bury the revealed card.	The Freedom Five destroy the TerraLunar Impulsion Beam! The Baron puts on his power suit and joins the fight himself! However, the heroes prove too much for the mad inventor. His suit explodes, taking out a wall. The rush of water floods the Baron out, never to be seen again... Mere days later, Baron Blade assaults Megalopolis. Clad once again in his power suit, Baron Blade goes toe-to-toe with Legacy. The battle armor is repaired but not entirely fixed from the end of the Moonfall event. As a result, during the fight, when Legacy punches a sparking panel on Blade's back, the entire suit explodes. Baron Blade is presumed dead. He couldn't have escaped again, surely.	Moonfall #1-#6 Freedom Five #223-#224	Dangerous Disruption	Tachyon hates to admit it, but she's actually learned a lot from observing Baron Blade's unsafe practices. She can replicate some of his effects, but with safety measures.	Destroy any number of Hero Ongoing and/or Item cards. Then, 1 Villain target deals itself 2 lightning damage, +2 for each card destroyed this way.	Timestream Tampering	Someone is altering the timestream! They seem to know you, but you've certainly never heard of anyone called "La Comodora."	Put 1 card from each trash under the top card of the associated deck.	Core Game	
Wayward Sun	May 1987	The Freedom Five have picked up a strange transmission that seems to have come from beyond the stars! Some piece of alien technology has made its way through the planet's atmosphere and is transmitting a distress signal as it plummets towards the Earth. Could this be some alien in need of aid, or might it be a trap left over from the recent Thorathian invasion? Heroes including the Freedom Five and their new ally Expatriette head to Insula Primalis to investigate, though they know that Citizen Dawn controls that island. She and her hordes of Citizens will oppose the heroes at every turn.	1	Citizen Dawn	Alien Influence	Citizen cards are immune to any type of damage that their game text says they deal.	Before this event, the Citizens of the Sun were a mostly faceless group of powerful minions for Citizen Dawn, other than a couple notable exceptions. However, with the alien artifact empowering the Citizens, they each took on new aspects of power, making them greater threats and paving the way for later events featuring the Citizens of the Sun. After the artifact was unearthed by the Citizens, it hovered around the island, avoiding capture and monitoring the fight between costumed heroes and super-powered extremists. Eventually, it apparently had observed enough of the conflict, and the mysterious artifact flew away, having left its mark on the Citizens of the Sun and their home.	Freedom Five #445-#447	Power to the Powerless	Citizen Dawn only cares about superpowered people. All others are insignificant insects in her eyes, even her powerless daughter. As Expatriette joins the ranks of the heroes, Citizen Dawn might learn to not ignore her unpowered foes.	1 Hero discovers 2 Item cards.	Dark Twistings	Citizen Dawn was defeated with the help of an ally who seems perhaps not so heroic. "I'm only here to help," the Visionary insists, with a sinister smile.	1 Hero uses 1 power. If that power deals damage, +3 to that damage, and change that damage to a type of your choice. Then, that hero discards 1 card.	Core Game	
Invasion of Earth	Dec 1986	In one of the biggest Sentinel Comics events of all time, Grand Warlord Voss's Thorathian Conquering Fleet appears in our solar system and begins its assault on planet Earth! The Grand Warlord's troops set up a temporary base on Mars, from which they are able to launch nigh-endless waves of Gene-Bound minions to Earth, using quark-drive translocation technology. Meanwhile, Voss and his Thorathian commanders take the fight to the heroes themselves, taking down some of the mightiest heroes early on in an attempt to deprive the planet of its defenders...	2	Grand Warlord Voss	Warlord's Tactics	If there are no Gene-Bound cards in play, +1 damage dealt by Villain cards. If there are any Gene-Bound cards in play, -1 damage dealt to Thorathian cards.	Voss's invasion almost ended humanity. Legacy was knocked out early on and the heroes were disheartened and in disarray. But when Felicia, Legacy's daughter, joined the fight wearing a Legacy costume, she provided much needed inspiration. The Prime Wardens joined the fight on Mars, destroying the gene-binding facilities and translocators. They then returned to Earth... all except for Tempest. Instead, he attacked Voss, not content with routing the Thorathian forces. Tempest and Voss ultimately fought in the Realm of Discord, but only Tempest emerged alive.	Cosmic Tales Vol. 2 #202-#204 Freedom Five #440-#442 Thorathian Gene-Binding Journal One-Shot America's Finest Legacy #180-#182 Justice Comics #381 Prime Wardens Vol. 1 #14-#16	Smarter Devices	In the aftermath of the clash between would-be conquerors from the stars and the stalwart heroes of Earth, science and technology have advanced quickly due to recovered Thorathian devices.	1 Hero discovers 1 Item card. Then, that Hero may use 1 power.	Unwavering Order	Grand Warlord Voss was a tyrant, but his ruthless efficiency in terms of troop deployment and military structure cannot be denied. We can learn from his successes while still not walking at all in his terrible footsteps.	Discover up to 3 targets from 1 deck.	Core Game	
Night's Plutonian Shore	Oct 1998	The Matriarch's classic first appearance in the Silver Age of Sentinel Comics was reprised in the late '90s with the "Night's Plutonian Shore" One-Shot. In this telling of the story, the Matriarch posed a far greater threat, surrounded by scores of corvids and accompanied by two powerful avian cohorts. When the foul avian swarm descends upon Rook City, the heroes assemble to try to protect the citizens of the blighted boroughs. Ultimately, the story is a battle of science vs. magic, with the super-scientist Tachyon attempting to outwit the overwhelming power of her cousin the Matriarch!	2	The Matriarch	Pestilent Corvids	Whenever a Cohort card is destroyed, it deals the Hero target with the highest HP 3 toxic damage.	This retelling of the Matriarch's story also added another layer of nuance to the character. During this event, the readers and the heroes alike saw how overwhelmed Lillian Corvus was by the power of the Matriarch. As much as she was a dangerous villain fueled by fury, she was also a scared teenager who was being controlled by the mask as much as she was using its power. When the heroes defeated the Matriarch by subduing her cohorts, reaching the center of the avian maelstrom, and unmasking Lillian, she was captured and sent to prison. However, from this point forward, her cousin Dr. Meredith Stinson visited her often to talk about what happened.	Night's Plutonian Shore One-Shot Freedom Five #583	Focus and Control	The Matriarch has a connection to her mask unlike anything that NightMist had ever seen. If that reliance could be tempered, that bond could be quite the boon.	1 Hero summons 1 Relic card. Then, that hero regains up to 5 HP.	Overreaction	You shudder as you think of the hordes of terrible fowl that blotted out the sun as they filled the grey sky. Even the slightest "caw" from a seemingly innocent passing crow makes you jump.	Destroy up to 3 targets with 3 or fewer HP.	Core Game	
Singularity	Apr 1976	Omnitron in a massive robotic form attacks the Eastern seaboard, leading to a conflict in Megalopolis with the Freedom Five. The heroes mobilize and protect the city, and even seem successful in destroying the rampaging robot... but their victory is short-lived. Omnitron isn't a pile of metal parts -- it's the code, and that code has started infecting all electronics it encounters. Now that Omnitron conflicts are occurring everywhere, the heroes must scramble to deal with this incursion on many fronts, knowing that the only way to truly win is to isolate all of the Omnitron code before it can assimilate everything!	1	Omnitron	Pervasive Omnicode	Each Item card gains the keyword "Device", has 6 HP, and gains the following game text: END PHASE This card deals each non-Device Hero target 1 lightning damage.	At every turn, Omnitron was ahead of the heroes. Haka rampaged through a crowd of robot drones, destroying them by the handful, but he was still surrounded. Ra brought forth his hottest flames, only to watch Omnitron's frame become immune to extreme temperatures. It wasn't until the heroes were unexpectedly aided by a time-traveling robot that the conflict changed. This future version of Omnitron called itself "Omnitron-X". It was here to correct its past wrongs, and it paid the ultimate price to do so. When Omnitron attempted to overpower the Omnitron-X code, the robot from the future corrupted the Omnitron programming, ending its endless assimilation. The robot menace was no more.	Singularity #1-#8 Mystery Comics Vol. 1 #359 Freedom Five #315-#316	Refactored Code	Tampering with the Omnicode is risky, but the possibilities of such a powerful learning algorithm are too good to pass up. Fortunately, there's a definitely fail-safe way to study the code that surely will have no long-term consequences.	1 Hero draws 1 card and summons 1 Item card. Then, that Hero deals each target 1 fixed lightning damage.	Reverse Engineered Virus	What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, so what doesn't make you stronger, kills you? That certainly seems to be the core programming of Omnitron!	Destroy 1 non-character Device card, or 1 target with 7 or fewer HP.	Core Game
