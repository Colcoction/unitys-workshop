Mother Earth	Jan 1986	The ancient earth-spirit Akash'Bhuta has bested her continual foe. With this latest Virtuoso of the Void defeated, nothing can possibly stand in her way -- humanity shall finally be laid low! The Argent Adept is rescued by Fanatic, and they are joined by Captain Cosmic and Tempest. They travel to the time-lost island of Insula Primalis, where they find Haka already locked in combat with Void-altered dinosaurs. And with that, the new team known as the Prime Wardens is complete. The heroes descend into the heart of the island to face the spirit of the earth itself...	1	Akash'Bhuta	Heart of the Island	After an Environment card is destroyed, Akash'Bhuta deals each target 2 fire damage.	The Prime Wardens fought their way through the heart of Insula Primalis to separate Akash'Bhuta from that ancient island's power. The Argent Adept had to enter the Void and face her essence alone. He was barely able to survive and sever Akash'Bhuta's connection, but succeed he did. And just in time! The Freedom Five arrived to join forces against the formidable earth spirit. Even still, all would have been lost if not for the timely intervention of a shadowy gunman who seemed to appear from nowhere, take the precisely necessary shot, and disappear without a word. With his aid, the heroes were able to defeat Akash'Bhuta and save the day!	Virtuoso of the Void Vol. 1 #152 Absolution #68 Cosmic Tales Vol. 2 #190 Prime Wardens Vol. 1 #1-#6 Mother Earth One-Shot Freedom Five Annual #10	Bloviating Academic	Soothsayer Carmichael is annoyed by the way you do things. "If you would spend even a moment considering the ramifications of your actions!" he rages, pacing this way and that. He has some good points, but he really needs to get over himself.	Reveal the top 3 cards of 1 deck. Replace them in any order.	Primordial Power	Over millennia, Akash'Bhuta has become a part of this world in a way that cannot be easily undone. In fighting her, you fight the planet itself. Similarly, in defeating her, you gain some dominion over this world.	Destroy and/or bury up to 3 Environment cards.	Core Game	
To Hunt a Hero	Apr 1988	A dangerous new villain has appeared: Ambuscade, the super-human big game hunter! He is always looking for a greater challenge, for more prestige! What could be more glorious than defeating the powerful Haka himself? Ambuscade has quite the flair for the dramatic. His ambush tactics, invisibility tech, and dangerous devices begin to aggravate even Haka. Will the biggest game hunter take down the biggest hero?	1	Ambuscade	Only Takes One	After Ambuscade's character card flips to the "Hunter of the Mighty" side, Ambuscade deals the Hero character with the lowest HP (H) melee damage. If any Hero is ever incapacitated, Ambuscade has successfully completed his hunt. Game Over.	Against all odds, Ambuscade seemed to get the better of Haka at every turn! At least, until Haka actually managed to get his hands on his slippery assailant. Once the fight came down to drawn out hand-to-hand combat, Ambuscades's fancy moves and clever ploys could only carry him so far. Ambuscade may be the flashier combatant, but Haka's age, experience, and seemingly inexhaustible strength allowed the Maori warrior to outlast Ambuscade. Haka survived all of Ambuscade's traps and ultimately defeated him, but with his failsafe invisibility, Ambuscade was able to slip away at the end. To be certain, he was most disappointed by this failure... but not to fear! Ambuscade will return! He's gotten a taste of the deadliest game and will not be satisfied with anything less!	The Savage Haka #1-#4	Holographic Lure	You recover a cloaked drone after the fight with Ambuscade, designed to lead civilians away. Maybe Ambuscade didn't want to be interrupted?	Shuffle any number of Environment targets into the Environment deck.	Time to Shine	Ambuscade may be a pain, but his timing is impeccable. Maybe it's time to take the lead and show the world what you can do?	After the END PHASE of this turn, go to the START PHASE of this turn.	Rook City Renegades	
Throne to the Wolves	Apr 2010	Apex the Wolf-King's terrifying pack has grown greatly, with many former pack alphas aligning their werewolf forces under Apex's banner. However, with that notoriety comes a deadly price. The throne of the Wolf-King is held by whichever werewolf is recognized as the mightiest, and the former pack alphas that have pledged their allegiance to Apex are all too ready to take his power for themselves if Apex shows even the slightest hint of weakness...	2	Apex	Leader of the Pack	When Apex would be destroyed, if there are any other Villain Werewolf cards in play, destroy the non-character Werewolf card with the lowest HP instead. After a card is destroyed this way, Apex regains 10 HP.	Over the course of the conflict, Apex was pleased to see Alpha lose herself in the fight. She tore through the ranks of his werewolf army, only proving further to the Wolf-King that she was far more of a true werewolf than anyone assumed. Attempting to regain control of the situation, NightMist performed a dark ritual to suppress the moon itself, forcing each werewolf into human form. Alpha returned to her senses, horrified at having let the wolf within have so much control over her. In a cliffhanger ending, Alpha is revealed by Apex to be a natural-born werewolf, not a person cursed as everyone had assumed. Faced with this horrific realization, she was unprepared for the further reveal that Apex is, in fact, the sire of Alpha's father.	Alpha: The Wolf-Woman Vol. 4 #19-#24 Dark Watch Vol. 1 #130-#135	Bloodcurdling Recording	The sounds of being hunted by a werewolf pack still haunt your nightmares. Why not give your enemies a taste of that fear?	1 Hero character deals 1 target 2 sonic damage. Destroy up to 3 Ongoing cards.	Latent Senses	One of those werewolves barely grazed you in that last fight. You're probably fine. But, you are aware that you can now smell the blood of your foes...	Reveal the top 3 cards of 1 non-Hero deck. Discard 1 of them and replace the other 2 in any order. 1 Hero character deals the target with the lowest HP 2 melee damage.	Rook City Renegades	
Moonfall	Apr 1968	The dastardly Baron Blade has a world-ending plan to destroy his nemesis Legacy once and for all! If the Freedom Five don't stop him in time, his terrible plot will spell doom for humanity. The revenge-fueled Baron set up his TerraLunar Impulsion Beam in the long abandoned ruins of Atlantis, hoping that after the pyrrhic victory of pulling the moon into the earth, he and his forces will emerge to rule what's left. The heroes must find their way through the twisting ruins to destroy the mad baron's doomsday device before it's too late!	0	Baron Blade	My Life for Mordengrad!	Whenever Baron Blade would be dealt damage, reveal the top card of the Villain deck. If it is a Minion card, play it and redirect the damage to that Minion card. Otherwise, bury the revealed card.	The Freedom Five destroy the TerraLunar Impulsion Beam! The Baron puts on his power suit and joins the fight himself! However, the heroes prove too much for the mad inventor. His suit explodes, taking out a wall. The rush of water floods the Baron out, never to be seen again... Mere days later, Baron Blade assaults Megalopolis. Clad once again in his power suit, Baron Blade goes toe-to-toe with Legacy. The battle armor is repaired but not entirely fixed from the end of the Moonfall event. As a result, during the fight, when Legacy punches a sparking panel on Blade's back, the entire suit explodes. Baron Blade is presumed dead. He couldn't have escaped again, surely.	Moonfall #1-#6 Freedom Five #223-#224	Dangerous Disruption	Tachyon hates to admit it, but she's actually learned a lot from observing Baron Blade's unsafe practices. She can replicate some of his effects, but with safety measures.	Destroy any number of Hero Ongoing and/or Item cards. Then, 1 Villain target deals itself 2 lightning damage, +2 for each card destroyed this way.	Timestream Tampering	Someone is altering the timestream! They seem to know you, but you've certainly never heard of anyone called "La Comodora."	Put 1 card from each trash under the top card of the associated deck.	Core Game	
Wayward Sun	May 1987	The Freedom Five have picked up a strange transmission that seems to have come from beyond the stars! Some piece of alien technology has made its way through the planet's atmosphere and is transmitting a distress signal as it plummets towards the Earth. Could this be some alien in need of aid, or might it be a trap left over from the recent Thorathian invasion? Heroes including the Freedom Five and their new ally Expatriette head to Insula Primalis to investigate, though they know that Citizen Dawn controls that island. She and her hordes of Citizens will oppose the heroes at every turn.	1	Citizen Dawn	Alien Influence	Citizen cards are immune to any type of damage that their game text says they deal.	Before this event, the Citizens of the Sun were a mostly faceless group of powerful minions for Citizen Dawn, other than a couple notable exceptions. However, with the alien artifact empowering the Citizens, they each took on new aspects of power, making them greater threats and paving the way for later events featuring the Citizens of the Sun. After the artifact was unearthed by the Citizens, it hovered around the island, avoiding capture and monitoring the fight between costumed heroes and super-powered extremists. Eventually, it apparently had observed enough of the conflict, and the mysterious artifact flew away, having left its mark on the Citizens of the Sun and their home.	Freedom Five #445-#447	Power to the Powerless	Citizen Dawn only cares about superpowered people. All others are insignificant insects in her eyes, even her powerless daughter. As Expatriette joins the ranks of the heroes, Citizen Dawn might learn to not ignore her unpowered foes.	1 Hero discovers 2 Item cards.	Dark Twistings	Citizen Dawn was defeated with the help of an ally who seems perhaps not so heroic. "I'm only here to help," the Visionary insists, with a sinister smile.	1 Hero uses 1 power. If that power deals damage, +3 to that damage, and change that damage to a type of your choice. Then, that hero discards 1 card.	Core Game	
The Curse of the Fey-Court	Jul 2002	The Heroes are welcomed into the Fey-Court, seemingly honored guests in this strange place. The grand revel begins, and all are invited to eat, drink, sing, and dance amongst the fey-courtiers! However, when the fey spirits wear off, something is amiss! The advisor who had helped the heroes is nowhere to be found, and the fey are all rather upset about what appears to be a mere misunderstanding...	1	The Fey-Court	Mercurial Court Proceedings	START PHASE Destroy the Advisor card with the highest HP. Discover 1 Advisor card. If no Advisor cards are destroyed or played, remove 1 token from each Villain character card and shuffle the Villain trash into the Villain deck.	When the court changed from the welcoming Summer Court to the frigid Winter Court, all of the members of the court changed as well, from the courtiers to the Dagda himself. What originally seemed a warm and welcoming place became cold and deadly. Only through the help of the leprechaun elder Ogma were the heroes able to get through to the rulers of the court and avoid the Morrigan's fury. Ultimately, the curse is lifted from Setback, and the rest of Dark Watch all paid their respects with intent to never return. All but one, that is. The Harpy had learned much from the Morrigan, and there was indication that this sharing of information -- and of power -- presented far more opportunities. What might the future hold here in the court of the fey?	Dark Watch Annual #3 Dark Watch Vol. 1 #37-#54	Beguiling Melody	A magical song, so alluring that hearing it compels the listener to wander off in search of the source.	Any number of targets deal themselves 1 fixed sonic damage and 1 fixed psychic damage. Then, bury up to 3 non-character targets with 3 or fewer HP.	Fey Summerwine	Years later, Paige Huntley drunkenly remembered that she was still technically married to Lugh, Champion of the Fey.	1 Hero character deals themself 1 toxic damage. 1 Hero puts any number of cards from their trash on top of their deck. Each Hero draws 2 cards.	Rook City Renegades	
The Fabric of Despair	Oct 1973	The Cult of Gloom has existed for centuries, but always deeply hidden away behind secrets and whispers. Now, a new leader of the cult has emerged -- Andrew Massey -- a charismatic warlock with more talent for twisting the hearts and minds of man than any aspect of the arcane arts. Cult Leader Massey has brought many new cultists into the fold, working with other powerful Chosen of Gloom to perform a dread ritual. The Chosen seek to bring together eldritch relics of Gloom to summon their terrible lord and master into this world. Who can stand in the way of this more organized Cult of Gloom?!	1	GloomWeaver	True Believers	END PHASE Discover 1 Chosen card. Each Chosen card regains (H) HP.	The Cult of Gloom had never been so organized before, but even still, they were unable to bring their dread lord and master into this world. The cursed master of magic known as NightMist undid the rituals that Massey and his allies constructed, trapping many of the cultists in the Realm of Discord with GloomWeaver, rather than letting the demon god through. This was no victory for the mortal realm, however. The anguish felt by the Cult of Gloom only further fed GloomWeaver himself -- bringing more gloom into the world was all he wanted, after all. The cult still has more focus and leadership than ever before, and the most powerful among them know that death is not the end. Servitude to GloomWeaver is eternal.	Fabric of Despair #1-#5 Tome of the Bizarre Vol. 2 #182-#183	The Fang of Taranerach	Among the relics of the Cult of Gloom is a most curious knife that radiates power and cuts through any barrier. What could one do with such a weapon?	1 Hero character deals 1 target 10 fixed melee damage. Each target deals itself 1 fixed psychic damage.	Forbidden Magicks	Turn your pain into eldritch power to spite a world that wronged you... terrible words, but perhaps one might use the teachings of Gloom for good?	1 Hero character deals themself 3 fixed psychic damage, then deals 1 target X infernal damage, where X is the difference between that Hero character's maximum and current HP.	Rook City Renegades	
Invasion of Earth	Dec 1986	In one of the biggest Sentinel Comics events of all time, Grand Warlord Voss's Thorathian Conquering Fleet appears in our solar system and begins its assault on planet Earth! The Grand Warlord's troops set up a temporary base on Mars, from which they are able to launch nigh-endless waves of Gene-Bound minions to Earth, using quark-drive translocation technology. Meanwhile, Voss and his Thorathian commanders take the fight to the heroes themselves, taking down some of the mightiest heroes early on in an attempt to deprive the planet of its defenders...	2	Grand Warlord Voss	Warlord's Tactics	If there are no Gene-Bound cards in play, +1 damage dealt by Villain cards. If there are any Gene-Bound cards in play, -1 damage dealt to Thorathian cards.	Voss's invasion almost ended humanity. Legacy was knocked out early on and the heroes were disheartened and in disarray. But when Felicia, Legacy's daughter, joined the fight wearing a Legacy costume, she provided much needed inspiration. The Prime Wardens joined the fight on Mars, destroying the gene-binding facilities and translocators. They then returned to Earth... all except for Tempest. Instead, he attacked Voss, not content with routing the Thorathian forces. Tempest and Voss ultimately fought in the Realm of Discord, but only Tempest emerged alive.	Cosmic Tales Vol. 2 #202-#204 Freedom Five #440-#442 Thorathian Gene-Binding Journal One-Shot America's Finest Legacy #180-#182 Justice Comics #381 Prime Wardens Vol. 1 #14-#16	Smarter Devices	In the aftermath of the clash between would-be conquerors from the stars and the stalwart heroes of Earth, science and technology have advanced quickly due to recovered Thorathian devices.	1 Hero discovers 1 Item card. Then, that Hero may use 1 power.	Unwavering Order	Grand Warlord Voss was a tyrant, but his ruthless efficiency in terms of troop deployment and military structure cannot be denied. We can learn from his successes while still not walking at all in his terrible footsteps.	Discover up to 3 targets from 1 deck.	Core Game	
Run of Luck	Nov 1997	Highbrow is one of those classic "criminal mastermind who doesn't want to do the hard work themselves" types. She hatches clever plans, pulls together a specific team of ne'er-do-wells, and watches the whole thing unfold from the safety of a secure and luxurious location. Normally, Kismet isn't into that kind of thing, but in this case, she's been hired to stand around a casino and make things go well for her crew and poorly for the heroes. That's the kind of work Kismet can get behind.	1	Kismet	Fortune's Blessing	After a Lucky card is played, discard the top card of 1 Hero deck. If the discarded card has any keywords that match any keywords on the played Lucky card, play the top card of the Villain deck.	Things have not been going well for Pete Riske. He ran into an old girlfriend at a casino. Turns out, that old girlfriend is the villain Kisme. And she's still holding a grudge after all these years. And she has probability controlling powers that make everyone around her unlucky. In the last hour, Setback fell into a giant fish tank, broke his arm, tripped over his own shoelaces, and accidentally ate food that was very expired. He'd certainly felt better. Just when Setback felt like giving up on handling his luck curse, things fell into place. It must be connected to Kismet! He apologized to her for how things went before -- they both deserved better. Kismet was unsure what to do with this and fled the scene. Just another day in the life of a hero.	Run of Luck #1-#7	Right Time and Place	Suddenly Setback falls through the skylight with just what you're looking for.	1 Hero draws 7 cards and regains 7 HP. 1 Hero collects 1 One-Shot card.	Obsessive Planning	Expatriette makes sure her plans account for a variety of unlikely circumstances. For instance, if Setback ever summons a demon while reading a recipe for chocolate cake, she has Plan M-4 (cake variant 3).	1 Hero collects 1 Item card. A second hero collects 1 Ongoing card. Each Hero target regains 1 HP.	Rook City Renegades	
Night's Plutonian Shore	Oct 1998	The Matriarch's classic first appearance in the Silver Age of Sentinel Comics was reprised in the late '90s with the "Night's Plutonian Shore" One-Shot. In this telling of the story, the Matriarch posed a far greater threat, surrounded by scores of corvids and accompanied by two powerful avian cohorts. When the foul avian swarm descends upon Rook City, the heroes assemble to try to protect the citizens of the blighted boroughs. Ultimately, the story is a battle of science vs. magic, with the super-scientist Tachyon attempting to outwit the overwhelming power of her cousin the Matriarch!	2	The Matriarch	Pestilent Corvids	Whenever a Cohort card is destroyed, it deals the Hero target with the highest HP 3 toxic damage.	This retelling of the Matriarch's story also added another layer of nuance to the character. During this event, the readers and the heroes alike saw how overwhelmed Lillian Corvus was by the power of the Matriarch. As much as she was a dangerous villain fueled by fury, she was also a scared teenager who was being controlled by the mask as much as she was using its power. When the heroes defeated the Matriarch by subduing her cohorts, reaching the center of the avian maelstrom, and unmasking Lillian, she was captured and sent to prison. However, from this point forward, her cousin Dr. Meredith Stinson visited her often to talk about what happened.	Night's Plutonian Shore One-Shot Freedom Five #583	Focus and Control	The Matriarch has a connection to her mask unlike anything that NightMist had ever seen. If that reliance could be tempered, that bond could be quite the boon.	1 Hero summons 1 Relic card. Then, that hero regains up to 5 HP.	Overreaction	You shudder as you think of the hordes of terrible fowl that blotted out the sun as they filled the grey sky. Even the slightest "caw" from a seemingly innocent passing crow makes you jump.	Destroy up to 3 targets with 3 or fewer HP.	Core Game	
Singularity	Apr 1976	Omnitron in a massive robotic form attacks the Eastern seaboard, leading to a conflict in Megalopolis with the Freedom Five. The heroes mobilize and protect the city, and even seem successful in destroying the rampaging robot... but their victory is short-lived. Omnitron isn't a pile of metal parts -- it's the code, and that code has started infecting all electronics it encounters. Now that Omnitron conflicts are occurring everywhere, the heroes must scramble to deal with this incursion on many fronts, knowing that the only way to truly win is to isolate all of the Omnitron code before it can assimilate everything!	1	Omnitron	Pervasive Omnicode	Each Item card gains the keyword "Device", has 6 HP, and gains the following game text: END PHASE This card deals each non-Device Hero target 1 lightning damage.	At every turn, Omnitron was ahead of the heroes. Haka rampaged through a crowd of robot drones, destroying them by the handful, but he was still surrounded. Ra brought forth his hottest flames, only to watch Omnitron's frame become immune to extreme temperatures. It wasn't until the heroes were unexpectedly aided by a time-traveling robot that the conflict changed. This future version of Omnitron called itself "Omnitron-X". It was here to correct its past wrongs, and it paid the ultimate price to do so. When Omnitron attempted to overpower the Omnitron-X code, the robot from the future corrupted the Omnitron programming, ending its endless assimilation. The robot menace was no more.	Singularity #1-#8 Mystery Comics Vol. 1 #359 Freedom Five #315-#316	Refactored Code	Tampering with the Omnicode is risky, but the possibilities of such a powerful learning algorithm are too good to pass up. Fortunately, there's a definitely fail-safe way to study the code that surely will have no long-term consequences.	1 Hero draws 1 card and summons 1 Item card. Then, that Hero deals each target 1 fixed lightning damage.	Reverse Engineered Virus	What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, so what doesn't make you stronger, kills you? That certainly seems to be the core programming of Omnitron!	Destroy 1 non-character Device card, or 1 target with 7 or fewer HP.	Core Game	
Built in a Day	Jan 1990	As the Chairman built his vast criminal enterprise, he stepped on many outstretched hands, kept a few allies close, betrayed the rest, and never looked back for even an instant. Now, the Organization is stronger than ever, but its sheer size and scope demand additional muscle in the ranks of leadership. The Chairman and his deadly right hand, the Operative, find their underbosses from many walks of life, but they all work toward the same goals: power, control, and profit.	1	The Organization	Retaliatory Patrolling	After a Villain target is destroyed, The Operative deals the Hero target with the highest HP 2 melee damage.	Many heroes attempted to stand in the way of the Organization. For all their successes, they seemed to make no real headway against the inevitable creeping corruption of this deeply rooted criminal enterprise. For every small-time thug they put behind bars, a suspiciously well-armed gang took to the streets. For every corrupt politician exposed, a wealthy campaign appeared, primed to put another patsy in their place. The Organization was always three steps ahead of any opposition, their influence running deep and their plans seemingly decades in the making. How could these criminals have such reach? Their influence is systemic, rotting the entire city from the inside out. The system is clearly broken, but is it beyond fixing?	Built in a Day #1-#6 Rook City Renegades #83-#84	Word on the Street	Sure, most of what you hear from your sources ranges from useless to outright lies... but on occasion they come through with key information.	Discard the top 3 cards of the Environment deck. Put 1 card from the Environment trash on top of the Environment deck.	Shady Suppliers	In Rook City, you can buy just about anything, if you're willing to pay for it. No questions asked or answered.	Either 1 Hero collects up to 3 Item cards, or up to 3 Heroes collect 1 Item card each.	Rook City Renegades	
Dominion of the Plague Rat	Aug 1988	The rumors of a massive rat-like creature stalking the sewers of Rook City abound! Those who live on the street level know the rumors have too much truth in them to be casually disregarded. The mix of toxic sludge, chemical testing remnants, growth hormones, and illicit drugs streaming from the Pike Industrial Complex has mutated someone -- or something -- in the sewers. Now, the Plague Rat hungers, and he knows where to find his next meal...	1	Plague Rat	Rapid Infection	After Plague Rat's Villain character card flips, discover 1 Ongoing card.	While the Wraith attempted to keep the peace and patrol the streets of Rook City, less publicly-known heroes Mister Fixer and Expatriette teamed up to deal directly with the mutated rodent threat, knowing that if they couldn't clean out the Rook City sewers, many lives would be in grave danger. They armed themselves and descended into the lair of filth and disease. Tracking the monster, they located Plague Rat's nest and found a number of infected civilians there. The heroes extracted the civilians, destroyed the nest, and -- after a dangerous fight in the dark with Plague Rat -- managed to escape with their lives. Though ultimately unsuccessful in getting rid of Plague Rat entirely, they were still able to drive it deeper into the sewers and make it think twice about preying on the people above.

Prelude of the Soulless	Aug 1983	The life-draining and life-ending Spite was one of the worst villains to stalk the streets of Rook City. Even the bravest of street-toughs feared him, avoiding the alleys and underpasses he was rumored to frequent. Of course, no one knew just where Spite might strike next, and most of the reports about him hung on mere shreds of fact. His powers grew with every kill as he prepared to take on the one hero who he blamed for making him the monster he became.	1	Spite	Evil Smile	After a Villain Ongoing card is destroyed, Spite deals the target other than himself with the lowest HP 2 infernal damage.	The Wraith thought she had finally caught Spite unawares, but he'd been waiting for her, and he had a hostage. The killer and the hero stared at each other, her with eyes filled with malice, him with eyes of mirth. "What are you going to do, hero? I hold her life in my hands. If you so much as twitch, I'll kill her -- it'll be all your fault. Are you ready for even more blood on your h-" Spite's words were cut off by a harsh gurgle as a wooden arrow suddenly sprouted from the middle of his forehead. As the Wraith turned to look for who fired the shot, Spite fell to the ground, unquestionably dead. The Wraith and the newcomer Parse weren't likely to see eye-to-eye on this, but at least Spite was gone and would never be a problem again.	Prelude of the Soulless One-Shot Rook City Renegades #3-#8 Mystery Comics Vol. 2 #88-#100	Grit	In the face of true evil, many will fall. But not today.	Each non-Villain target regains 3 HP.

Terrorform Mark II	Apr 2004	Based on RevoCorp's secret Terrorform project, this new Terrorform Mark II is equipped with reactive shielding to keep the heroes from so easily breaching the towering form. After-action reports from the first Terrorform indicated that it performed as intended, but with additional time in the field, it could have increased its scope and yield by at least 20%. With this run, Terrorform should be able to ramp up notable collaterals.	2	Terrorform	Mark II	After a card is put under the Villain character card, Terrorform deals each Hero target 2 lightning damage. If Terrorform has 50 or fewer HP, +1 damage dealt by Terrorform.	The first time a Terrorform attacked, the resulting battle almost entirely destroyed a national park. It was only due to the generosity of the company RevoCorp that the park was able to be saved and maintained, and the oil and mineral rights claimed by RevoCorp as part of the relief efforts seemed only fair. However, when the second Terrorform was defeated, there was comparatively little damage to the landscape and natural world. The heroes who arrived on the scene to stop this metal monstrosity seemed more in tune with nature and even magic. The Naturalist and Akash'Thriya headed up the offensive, with aid from the Argent Adept, Haka, and the Scholar. Whoever is behind these Terrorforms will hopefully be dissuaded from launching another one.	Tome of the Bizarre Vol. 3 #193-#198	Mark I Laser	After defeating Mark II, you trace it back to a scrap heap of prototypes, as well as the wreckage from the first Terrorform. Hadn't RevoCorp cleaned this all up?	1 Hero target deals 1 target 10 irreducible energy damage. Discard the top 3 cards of 1 non-Hero deck.	Prototype Resonator Coil	The multicoil sonic resonators were designed to level buildings en masse. A single coil could be used much more surgically to remove obstacles.	Shuffle up to 3 Environment cards from play and/or the Environment trash into the Environment deck.	Rook City Renegades
