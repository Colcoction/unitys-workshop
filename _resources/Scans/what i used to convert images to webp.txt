added webp library to path (one-time setup on a computer)

then ran this in _resources folder (future uses would need to be more narrow to not re-convert images):

for file in Scans/*/*/*; do cwebp -q 20 "$file" -o "${file%.*}.webp"; done

_new files conversion:

for file in Scans/_new/*/*; do cwebp -q 20 "$file" -o "${file%.*}.webp"; done


== SINGLE FOLDER METHOD ==

To convert all files in a single folder, run this command in that folder:

for file in *; do cwebp -q 20 "$file" -o "${file%.*}.webp"; done
